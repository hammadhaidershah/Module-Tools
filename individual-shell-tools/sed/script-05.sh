# TODO: Write a command to output input.txt with one change:
# If a line starts with a number and a space, make the line instead end with a space and the number.
# So line 6 which currently reads "37 Alisha" should instead read "Alisha 37".
# The output should contain 11 lines.

This is a sample file for experimenting with sed.

It contains many lines, and there are some things you may want to do with each of them.

We'll include some score information:
Alisha 37
Jacob 15
Pietro 7
Katya 3

We also should remember, when we go shopping, to get 4 items: oranges,cheese,bread,olives.
